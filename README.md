Garden Automation based on IOT technology

This project's main aim is to develop an automated watering system for my vegetable garden consisting of multiple raised beds (zones). 

Here are some key requirements:

- Fully automated watering of plants based on environmental elements data
- Support for individually controlled multiple watering zones, each with varying watering needs
- Can fully function in offline mode
- Independent, does not require additional software to be running actively on other computer(s)
- Smart system (improved) based on historical data


Hardware:
- Arduino Mega (one or multiple)
- Air Temperature Sensors
- Soil Moisture Sensors
- Soil Temperature Sensors
  

Software:

 - Homegrown
