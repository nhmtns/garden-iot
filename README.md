Garden Automation based on IOT technology

This project's main aim is to develop an automated watering system for vegetable garden consisting of multiple raised beds (zones). 

Here are some key requirements:

- Fully automated watering of plants based on environmental elements data
- Support multiple watering zones, each with varying watering needs
- Smart system (improved) based on historical data
- Can fully function in offline mode
- Independent, does not require additional software to be running actively on other computer(s)

Hardware:
- Arduino Mega (one or multiple)
- Air Temperature Sensors
- Soil Moisture Sensors
- Soil Temperature Sensors
  

Software:
  Homegrown
